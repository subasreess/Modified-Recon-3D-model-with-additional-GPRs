### Addition of GPR information and modification of the Recon 3D model

Gene associations for orphan reactions were identified using the HumanCyc database for those reactions for which EC numbers were gathered from different databases mentioned in the methods section (Romero et al., 2005). Gene associations for 303 such reactions were added. In that process, 25 additional genes were added to the modified Recon 3D model.

AdditionalGPRrules_Recon3D.xls contains the GPRs of 303 orphan reactions in the Recon 3D model curated from the HumanCyc Database 

modifiedRecon3d.mat is a modified version of Recon 3D Model constructed by taking additional reactions, genes, metabolites from the uncurated Recon 3D version.
